The OAuth flow allowed for this client.  Supported flows are:
"^DD",996.53,996.53,4,21,2,0)

"^DD",996.53,996.53,4,21,3,0)
U - User-Agent Flow : Suitable for clients typically implemented in user-
"^DD",996.53,996.53,4,21,4,0)
agents (for example, clients running inside a web browser) using a scripting 
"^DD",996.53,996.53,4,21,5,0)
language such as JavaScript. Mostly used by native applications for mobile or 
"^DD",996.53,996.53,4,21,6,0)
desktop, leveraging the embedded or external browser as the user-agent for 
"^DD",996.53,996.53,4,21,7,0)
authorization and it uses the Implicit Grant authorization.
"^DD",996.53,996.53,4,21,8,0)

"^DD",996.53,996.53,4,21,9,0)
W - Web Server Flow : This makes use of the Authorization Code grant and is a 
"^DD",996.53,996.53,4,21,10,0)
redirection-based flow which requires interaction with the end-user's user-
"^DD",996.53,996.53,4,21,11,0)
agent. Thus, it is most suitable for clients which are a part of web-server 
"^DD",996.53,996.53,4,21,12,0)
based applications, that are typically accessed via a web browser.
"^DD",996.53,996.53,4,21,13,0)

"^DD",996.53,996.53,4,21,14,0)
P - Username and Password Flow : Used only when there is a high trust between 
"^DD",996.53,996.53,4,21,15,0)
the client and the resource owner and when other flows are not viable, as it 
"^DD",996.53,996.53,4,21,16,0)
involves the transfer of the resource owner's credentials. Examples of 
"^DD",996.53,996.53,4,21,17,0)
clients can be a device operating system or a highly privileged application. 
"^DD",996.53,996.53,4,21,18,0)
This can also be used to migrate existing clients using HTTP Basic or Digest 
"^DD",996.53,996.53,4,21,19,0)
Authentication schemes to OAuth by converting the stored credentials to an 
"^DD",996.53,996.53,4,21,20,0)
access token.
"^DD",996.53,996.53,4,21,21,0)

"^DD",996.53,996.53,4,21,22,0)
C - Client Credentials Flow : OAuth is mainly used for delegated access, but 
"^DD",996.53,996.53,4,21,23,0)
there are cases when the client owns the resource or already has been granted 
"^DD",996.53,996.53,4,21,24,0)
the delegated access outside of a typical OAuth flow. Here you just exchange 
"^DD",996.53,996.53,4,21,25,0)
client credentials for an access token.

This is the name that identifies the property.  It is typically the name that

is emitted by the serializer, but this is not a requirement. An arbitrary tag

delimiter.  This may be used to provide additional information about the 
"^DD",998.1,998.12,.01,21,5,0)
entry.  For example, if a property requires multiple entries to implement the 
"^DD",998.1,998.12,.01,21,6,0)

"^DD",998.1,998.12,.01,21,7,0)

This is the name that identifies the property.  It is typically the name that 
"^DD",998.1,998.12,.01,21,2,0)
is emitted by the serializer, but this is not a requirement. An arbitrary tag 
"^DD",998.1,998.12,.01,21,3,0)
may also be appended to the property name using the "!" character as a 
"^DD",998.1,998.12,.01,21,4,0)
delimiter.  This may be used to provide additional information about the 
"^DD",998.1,998.12,.01,21,5,0)
entry.  For example, if a property requires multiple entries to implement the 
"^DD",998.1,998.12,.01,21,6,0)
logic required to emit it, the tag can provide information to the user as to 
"^DD",998.1,998.12,.01,21,7,0)

This is the name that identifies the property.  It is typically the name that

is emitted by the serializer, but this is not a requirement. An arbitrary tag

delimiter.  This may be used to provide additional information about the 
"^DD",998.1,998.12,.01,21,5,0)
entry.  For example, if a property requires multiple entries to implement the 
"^DD",998.1,998.12,.01,21,6,0)

This is the name that identifies the property.  It is typically the name that 
"^DD",998.1,998.12,.01,21,2,0)
is emitted by the serializer, but this is not a requirement. An arbitrary tag 
"^DD",998.1,998.12,.01,21,3,0)
may also be appended to the property name using the "!" character as a 
"^DD",998.1,998.12,.01,21,4,0)
delimiter.  This may be used to provide additional information about the 
"^DD",998.1,998.12,.01,21,5,0)
entry.  For example, if a property requires multiple entries to implement the 
"^DD",998.1,998.12,.01,21,6,0)
logic required to emit it, the tag can provide information to the user as to 
"^DD",998.1,998.12,.01,21,7,0)
the role each entry plays.  For any given entry, the serializer may choose to 
"^DD",998.1,998.12,.01,21,8,0)
apply additional significance to the tag.

The actual polling interval is dependent on the event polling

This is the name that identifies the property.  It is typically the name that
